## üîß ACTION PLAN FOR YOU

1. **Write down 2 case studies per LP** now (you need 16 total)
2. Practice speaking them out loud using the STAR format
3. Finalize your **presentation deck** by **24th June**
4. Reach out for a **mock interview or review** (I can simulate questions)
5. Stay calm and speak slowly ‚Äî Mona already advised this, and it matters for public-facing roles

---

## ‚úÖ KEY REMINDER

The **most critical LPs for this role** (must be positive):

* **Learn & Be Curious**
* **Earn Trust**
* **Dive Deep**

These carry **high weight** in Amazon‚Äôs hiring bar, especially for Developer Advocate roles.

---

Absolutely, Veera! Below are **2 case studies for each interview** aligned with the **relevant AWS Leadership Principles (LPs)** you're being evaluated on.

Each case is structured to follow the **STAR method** and can be customized based on your real work experience. You should rehearse and adapt these to reflect **your own voice, metrics, and contributions.**

## üìÖ **24 June ‚Äì Amit Tiwari**

### LPs: 1. Customer Obsession & 2. Insist on Highest Standards

### ‚úÖ Case Study 1: Developer Onboarding Portal (Customer Obsession)

* **S**: Your internal developers struggled with onboarding due to scattered docs and inconsistent AWS project templates.
* **T**: You decided to build a centralized onboarding portal.
* **A**: You interviewed devs, used Amplify to build a self-serve React app with tutorials, boilerplate projects, and CDK deployment buttons.
* **R**: Reduced average onboarding time from 5 days to 2; received recognition from your platform team.

### ‚úÖ Case Study 2: CI/CD Break Fix (Highest Standards)

* **S**: Your team‚Äôs pipeline deployed broken frontend bundles because no tests were enforced.
* **T**: Improve quality checks without slowing release velocity.
* **A**: Introduced React Testing Library, snapshot tests, and enforced test thresholds in CodeBuild; integrated SonarQube.
* **R**: Defects in production dropped by 80%; test adoption increased across 3 teams.

## üìÖ **26 June ‚Äì Neerly / Replacement**

### LPs: 3. Think Big & 4. Earn Trust

### ‚úÖ Case Study 1: Open Developer Toolkit (Think Big)

* **S**: Multiple projects were building similar CDK components with small tweaks.
* **T**: You proposed a shared CDK construct library + documentation to unify infra deployment.
* **A**: Designed, published reusable CDK modules; held internal workshops to evangelize it.
* **R**: 5 teams adopted it, cutting setup time by 40%; nominated for internal excellence award.

### ‚úÖ Case Study 2: Owning a Production Issue (Earn Trust)

* **S**: A new Amplify release you helped test broke production auth flows.
* **T**: Even though you didn‚Äôt cause the bug, you owned the fix.
* **A**: Reproduced issue, coordinated with AWS support, deployed hotfix, documented postmortem transparently.
* **R**: Trust from stakeholders increased; your doc became the team‚Äôs standard playbook.

## üìÖ **26 June ‚Äì Houwen Hang**

### LPs: 5. Dive Deep & 6. Invent and Simplify

**+ Technical Presentation**

### ‚úÖ Case Study 1: GraphQL Performance Bottleneck (Dive Deep)

* **S**: Your React app using AppSync was showing latency issues.
* **T**: Identify root cause and fix without service disruption.
* **A**: Used X-Ray + CloudWatch, found misconfigured VTL resolver causing scan on large dataset.
* **R**: Rewrote resolver with key-based access; latency dropped from 2s to <150ms; helped 2 other teams solve the same issue.

### ‚úÖ Case Study 2: Self-Healing Preview Builds (Invent and Simplify)

* **S**: Preview environments often broke due to bad feature branch merges.
* **T**: Simplify and automate build pipeline integrity.
* **A**: Created a self-healing Amplify pipeline that ran validation checks, auto-detected broken builds, and notified devs via Slack.
* **R**: 25% reduction in QA effort, improved release confidence across sprints.

üé§ **Presentation Tip**: Include one of these in your presentation if allowed ‚Äî it shows technical ownership + DevEx improvement.

---

## üìÖ **27 June ‚Äì Belinda**

### LPs: 7. Learn & Be Curious & 8. Have Backbone; Disagree & Commit

* **S**: You were assigned to build a fullstack demo with AppSync and had no prior GraphQL experience.
* **T**: Deliver a live example app for an AWS event in <1 week.
* **A**: Studied AppSync docs, used Amplify to scaffold project, learned resolver tuning with VTL and JS, integrated auth via Cognito.
* **R**: Delivered demo ahead of deadline, and later wrote a blog post that helped others get started with AppSync.

### ‚úÖ Case Study 2: Disagreement on Tooling Stack (Disagree & Commit)

* **S**: A peer wanted to use Firebase for a web dashboard; you believed AWS Amplify was better aligned with org infra.
* **T**: Convince the team to shift while maintaining harmony.
* **A**: Presented pros/cons with metrics, ran a PoC to prove Amplify‚Äôs CI/CD and Cognito integration, but respected the team‚Äôs final vote.
* **R**: Though the initial version used Firebase, your architecture was adopted for v2 ‚Äî and you supported the project professionally throughout.
