Great list of questions! Here's how you can prepare structured, high-impact answers for each category: **Technical**, **Advocacy**, and **Behavioral (based on Amazon's Leadership Principles)** — with **sample answers**, **tips**, and **AWS tie-ins** where applicable.

## 📌 TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

### ✅ Q1: *How do you optimize a React app for performance?*

**Sample Answer:**

> I start by auditing performance using tools like Chrome DevTools and Lighthouse. I focus on key metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI).
>
> Then I apply techniques such as:
>
> * **Code splitting** using dynamic imports and React.lazy()
> * **Tree shaking** to eliminate unused code (especially with libraries like lodash)
> * **Memoization** with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`
> * **Lazy loading** of components and images
> * **Avoiding unnecessary re-renders** by managing state properly
>
> In a recent project, I reduced TTI from 6.3s to 2.1s by splitting vendor and page bundles and implementing lazy image loading. This improved both UX and SEO.

### ✅ Q2: *Explain how you’d deploy a React + Node.js app using AWS services.*

**Sample Answer:**

> I'd start by deploying the React frontend using **AWS Amplify**, which handles CI/CD from GitHub, automatic builds, and environment management. For custom configurations, I'd consider **S3 + CloudFront** with `aws s3 sync` for deployment.
>
> For the Node.js backend:
>
> * Use **AWS Lambda + API Gateway** for a serverless approach
> * If persistent compute is needed, use **ECS Fargate**
>
> I'd manage routing and auth with:
>
> * **Cognito** for user authentication
> * **Route 53** for custom domain
> * **CloudWatch** for logging and metrics
>
> For a fullstack serverless app, **Amplify Hosting + Amplify Functions + Cognito + DynamoDB** is fast and powerful.

### ✅ Q3: *Tradeoffs: Amplify vs S3 + CloudFront + Cognito?*

| Criteria            | Amplify                               | S3 + CloudFront + Cognito (Manual Setup)       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed to deploy** | Very fast (CLI & GitHub CI/CD)        | Slower – more setup and permissions needed     |
| **Flexibility**     | Somewhat opinionated                  | Full control over infrastructure               |
| **Custom backends** | Limited to Amplify-supported APIs     | Can integrate anything (ALB, EC2, custom auth) |
| **Dev Experience**  | Great DX with CLI and GraphQL tooling | Manual SDK setup, IAM policies, config         |
| **Use case**        | MVPs, rapid prototyping, small teams  | Enterprises, legacy migration, or custom needs |

## 📌 ADVOCACY QUESTIONS

### ✅ Q1: *Tell us about a piece of content you created that had an impact.*

> I published a blog post on **“How to Set Up React Authentication with AWS Cognito in 15 Minutes”**.
> It included a GitHub repo, video walkthrough, and visual flowcharts.
>
> * Got **25,000+ views**, shared on Reddit and Hacker News.
> * Helped devs debug Amplify/Cognito integration, and I tracked dozens of GitHub repos that forked my sample.
> * Later, AWS included it in their weekly community roundup.

---

### ✅ Q2: *How do you stay connected to the developer community?*

> I stay engaged through:
>
> * **GitHub**: watch repos, submit issues/PRs
> * **Stack Overflow**: answer Amplify and AppSync questions
> * **Twitter/X**: follow trends, run polls, share content
> * **Conferences & Meetups**: attend and speak at JS/AWS events
> * I also hang out on **Discord servers** (e.g., Reactiflux, AWS Developers)
>
> This helps me surface real dev pain points and create content that matters.

---

### ✅ Q3: *Describe a time you advocated for a developer need internally.*

> Our docs were too AWS-jargon-heavy for frontend devs. I pushed for a simpler onboarding guide.
>
> * I ran a small developer survey and gathered quotes like “I don’t understand IAM policies.”
> * I presented this to the docs and product team with suggestions for improvements.
> * We launched a new “Frontend Quick Start” section.
>
> Within a month, we saw **bounce rate drop by 30%** on that page.

---

## 📌 BEHAVIORAL (LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES)

### ✅ Q1: *Tell me about a time you disagreed with a team decision.*

> We were going to write custom auth for a frontend project instead of using Cognito. I disagreed due to security and maintenance concerns.
>
> * I shared a risk matrix and demoed Cognito integration in a lunch session.
> * The team agreed to prototype both. My approach won based on ease of use and scalability.
> * We saved 2 weeks of dev time and avoided reinventing the wheel.

### ✅ Q2: *How did you handle a failed launch or content misfire?*

> I once published a blog that used an outdated Amplify version. It broke for many devs.
>
> * I quickly updated the post with version warnings, fixed the code repo, and replied to all GitHub issues.
> * I followed up with a version compatibility matrix post and a tweet thread explaining the fix.
>
> The community appreciated the transparency, and I learned to test with multiple versions before publishing.

### ✅ Q3: *How do you prioritize between writing code, content, and community engagement?*

> I follow a weekly planning system:
>
> * **Mornings** are for deep work (code/content creation)
> * **Afternoons** for meetings, async reviews, and community replies
> * I use metrics to guide my efforts — if a blog is trending, I double down. If GitHub issues spike, I pause to help.
>
> Balance comes from understanding what delivers the most impact for the developer journey.
