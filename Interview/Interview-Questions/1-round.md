That’s great, Veera! Tomorrow’s round will focus on:

* ✅ **Customer Obsession**
* ✅ **Insist on Highest Standards**

As discussed earlier, Amazon prefers answers in the **STAR format**:
**S**ituation → **T**ask → **A**ction → **R**esult.

Below are **2 case studies for each LP**, tailored to your background as a **developer and technical leader** working with cloud and frontend technologies.

---

## 🧭 1. **Customer Obsession**

Amazon wants to see how deeply you care about your users — internal or external — and how you went above expectations to serve them.

---

### ✅ **Case Study 1: Developer Onboarding Portal**

**S**: New developers on your team were taking 4–5 days to set up local dev environments and understand your AWS app infrastructure. This slowed velocity and caused repeated errors.

**T**: Improve developer onboarding experience and reduce setup time.

**A**:

* Created a React-based self-service onboarding portal.
* Integrated it with Amplify to demo how to use Cognito, AppSync, and S3.
* Added video walkthroughs, common commands, and auto-deploy setup from GitHub.

**R**:

* Onboarding time reduced to **<1.5 days**
* Used by **3+ teams** internally
* Received direct feedback from new hires calling it “frictionless”

---

### ✅ **Case Study 2: Declining a Misaligned Feature Request**

**S**: A client requested a feature that required heavy backend customization and added risk, but it did not align with your product’s long-term roadmap.

**T**: Communicate and defend the decision while still helping the customer.

**A**:

* Organized a working session with the client.
* Suggested an alternative using existing AppSync resolvers + filters.
* Built a quick POC to demonstrate the new approach.
* Explained how the new method reduced cost and tech debt.

**R**:

* Customer agreed with the alternative
* Feature delivered in **2 sprints less** than estimated
* Strengthened client relationship with transparency

## 🧪 2. **Insist on Highest Standards**

This LP checks whether you hold a high quality bar and improve the standard — even when it’s not easy or comfortable.

---

### ✅ **Case Study 1: Broken Builds Due to Poor Testing**

**S**: Your team’s React app was regularly breaking production after new feature merges. Testing was not enforced across frontend pipelines.

**T**: Raise code quality and enforce testing best practices.

**A**:

* Introduced **React Testing Library** and **Jest** with a minimum coverage threshold.
* Updated Amplify CI pipeline to block merges without passing tests.
* Hosted test-writing workshops for junior devs.

**R**:

* Production issues dropped by **80% in 2 months**
* Increased unit test coverage from **35% → 85%**
* Raised team confidence and sped up releases

---

### ✅ **Case Study 2: Content Quality as a Developer Advocate**

**S**: You wrote a blog post on AWS CDK usage internally. Initial version was helpful but had typos, shallow examples, and lacked edge-case handling.

**T**: Improve the quality before it was shared to the external community.

**A**:

* Added error-handling scenarios, visual diagrams, and GitHub source code.
* Reviewed the post with 2 SDE peers before publishing.
* Benchmarked performance of CDK vs manual setup.

**R**:

* Blog was praised by 3 teams internally
* Later shared externally, received 1000+ views and positive LinkedIn feedback
* Used as onboarding doc for new AWS CDK users in your org

## 🔁 **Customer Obsession — Case Study 3**

### ✅ **Case Study: Simplifying Auth for External Developers**

**S**: Internal and partner devs struggled with setting up user authentication in their Amplify projects — especially social login and MFA.

**T**: Improve developer experience around Cognito integration.

**A**:

* Created a **step-by-step guide** with screenshots and reusable code snippets for configuring Amplify Auth with social providers.
* Created a live demo app + GitHub repo + YouTube walkthrough.
* Collected feedback and refined based on real developer pain points.

**R**:

* Dev adoption increased: shared by 2 internal teams and 1 AWS partner
* Reduced Cognito-related support tickets by 60%
* Blog got 800+ views and positive community engagement

---

## 🔁 **Customer Obsession — Case Study 4**

### ✅ **Case Study: Prioritized Fix for Low-Impact Bug Reported by Customer**

**S**: A minor UI bug in your deployed React app wasn’t affecting core functionality but was flagged by a power user repeatedly.

**T**: Even though the impact was low, you wanted to show responsiveness.

**A**:

* Logged it as a high-priority ticket in the sprint.
* Fixed the layout + wrote regression tests to prevent recurrence.
* Reached out directly to thank the user for their feedback.

**R**:

* Increased trust with that user and team
* Bug didn’t resurface, and your app rating improved
* The customer later gave a testimonial for your team’s responsiveness

## 🏗 **Insist on Highest Standards — Case Study 3**

### ✅ **Case Study: Upgrading Code Quality Across Microservices**

**S**: Legacy microservices written in Python and Node.js had no linter, inconsistent naming, and lacked logging standards.

**T**: Standardize code structure across all repos.

**A**:

* Created ESLint/Prettier configs, added CI hooks, and a service bootstrap template.
* Set up centralized error logging via CloudWatch with structured JSON logs.
* Documented and enforced these via GitHub PR templates and code reviews.

**R**:

* Reduced onboarding time for new devs by 50%
* Improved debuggability during incidents
* Review cycles became faster and more consistent

---

## 🏗 **Insist on Highest Standards — Case Study 4**

### ✅ **Case Study: Amplify Demo Code Rewritten Before Public Launch**

**S**: You built a React + Amplify demo that worked well but had hardcoded secrets, missing validations, and minimal comments.

**T**: You were scheduled to present it in a public DevTalk, so you raised the quality bar.

**A**:

* Refactored it with proper environment variables
* Added validation checks, error handling, and user feedback
* Documented setup and teardown instructions for community use

**R**:

* Talk received great feedback
* 3 people forked the repo to use in their own demos
* Code was reused by another team in a hackathon
