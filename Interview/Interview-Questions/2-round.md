Thanks, Veera. Based on your **resume** and experience, here are **tailored real-life case studies** aligned with today’s Amazon Leadership Principles: **Think Big** and **Earn Trust** — written in STAR format using your actual projects and impact.

## ✅ Think Big (2 Real Case Studies)

---

### 💡 Case Study 1: **Internal Developer Portal with Temporal Workflows**

**Situation:**
At CLAR Technologies, your infra team was struggling to manage high-throughput Linux server provisioning requests manually, resulting in delays and inconsistencies.

**Task:**
As a fullstack engineer, you took ownership to streamline the experience and reduce human dependency in the provisioning flow.

**Action:**
You architected and built an **Internal Developer Portal (IDP)** using React and Golang, integrating Temporal workflows and AWS to orchestrate Linux server requests at scale. It aggregated real-time server metrics, automated provisioning, and gave engineers a self-service dashboard.

**Result:**

* Reduced request resolution time from hours to minutes
* Improved observability and reduced human error
* Empowered 10+ engineers to manage infra requests independently
* Became a model reused by other teams inside the org

🎯 **Demonstrates:** 10x thinking, scalability, enabling others to move faster.

### 💡 Case Study 2: **Custom Code Generator CLI for UI Automation**

## ✅ What You Did Well

| Area                     | Comments                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ **Real customer pain** | You clearly explained the growing complexity due to expanding data tables                        |
| ✅ **Scalable thinking**  | You identified the long-term bottleneck of manually building pages                               |
| ✅ **Ownership**          | You went beyond your task and built a CLI tool — this shows bias for action + long-term thinking |
| ✅ **Clear result**       | You quantified impact: 1 week → 30 mins turnaround per page                                      |

## 🛠 Suggestions to Improve for Interview

1. **Summarize up front**:

   * “We were scaling from 10 → 60+ datasets. Manually building UI pages didn’t scale. I built a codegen CLI to automate it.”
   * This hooks the interviewer early.

2. **Trim tech stack depth slightly unless asked**:

   * Keep `React + Next.js`, `Go microservices`, and `RDS` mentioned — but avoid deep internals unless it's a technical round.

3. **Emphasize enablement of others**:

   * Call out: “This tool was adopted by other teams. Even new devs with no context could now generate fully functional, styled, tested pages in minutes.”

4. **Result in bullet or sharp sentence**:

   * “This reduced UI delivery time from 1 week to under 30 minutes. Productivity improved 10x and unblocked future scale to 150+ datasets.”

## 🧠 Summary You Can Use in the Interview

> *“We were scaling from 10 to 60+ data pipelines, each needing a dashboard UI. Manually building these in React/Next.js took \~1 week per dataset. I foresaw this wouldn’t scale, so I built a CLI code generator that took schema + config and auto-generated full UI pages with test cases, hooks, and styling. This dropped build time to under 30 minutes. The tool enabled all teams to scale confidently as we grew to 100+ datasets. It was reused org-wide and dramatically boosted velocity.”*

When you're ready, say **“Next”** and I’ll ask a question for **Earn Trust**. You're doing great 🔥

## ✅ Earn Trust (2 Real Case Studies)

---

Excellent, Veera — this is a very strong and **honest** case study for **Earn Trust**. It shows not only technical depth but your **accountability and proactive ownership**.

Here’s my structured feedback and polishing tips to make it shine in the interview:

## ✅ What You Did Well

| Category                   | Feedback                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ **Admitting oversight**  | You clearly acknowledged that you initially missed adding worker pools and efficient DB handling |
| ✅ **Taking ownership**     | You didn’t blame infra or other teams — you investigated and fixed it                            |
| ✅ **Customer-centric fix** | Focused on improving **customer latency**, aligning directly with trust-building                 |
| ✅ **Scalable solution**    | Use of **RDS Proxy + caching + indexing** shows a thoughtful, layered fix                        |
| ✅ **Quantified impact**    | Brought down response time from **2-3s to 200ms** — that’s a huge performance gain               |

## 🛠 Suggestions to Improve the Flow

### 1. Begin with the **problem clearly**

> *“In our Skuchain multi-tenant platform, as users scaled from <10 to 100+, latency for dashboard access jumped from <1s to 3s+, affecting customer experience.”*

### 2. Briefly say what **mistake you made**

> *“Initially, we didn’t implement proper connection pooling or use RDS Proxy. I missed recognizing this during design reviews, which impacted performance under scale.”*

### 3. Emphasize **your proactive fix**

> *“I took full ownership to profile queries, add worker pools, and integrate RDS Proxy. We also implemented indexing and Memcached for frequently accessed data.”*

### 4. State **Result crisply**

> *“This reduced query latency from \~3s to \~250ms across tenants. Customers reported significant improvement, and it rebuilt trust with our largest clients.”*

## 🔁 STAR Format Polished Summary

> **S:** At Skuchain, as our multi-tenant SaaS scaled from <10 to 100+ clients, users began experiencing dashboard delays — query latency increased from <1s to 3s+.
> **T:** As fullstack owner of the backend and DB layer, I was responsible for fixing performance and ensuring customer trust.
> **A:** I investigated and realized we hadn’t used connection pooling or RDS Proxy. I led integration of RDS Proxy, added Postgres indexes, and implemented Memcached.
> **R:** This reduced average query response time from 3s to \~250ms — a 10x improvement. Customers were delighted, and trust in the platform was restored.

### 🙌 Tip Before the Interview

If they ask a follow-up like:

> *“Why didn’t you catch this in the beginning?”*

You can say:

> *“At the time, the tenant load was very low. I underestimated the scale-up risk. But once the symptoms appeared, I prioritized a fix immediately and also added scale tests going forward to avoid blind spots.”*
