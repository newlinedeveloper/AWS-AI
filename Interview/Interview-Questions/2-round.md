Thanks, Veera. Based on your **resume** and experience, here are **tailored real-life case studies** aligned with today’s Amazon Leadership Principles: **Think Big** and **Earn Trust** — written in STAR format using your actual projects and impact.

## ✅ Think Big (2 Real Case Studies)

---

### 💡 Case Study 1: **Internal Developer Portal with Temporal Workflows**

**Situation:**
At CLAR Technologies, your infra team was struggling to manage high-throughput Linux server provisioning requests manually, resulting in delays and inconsistencies.

**Task:**
As a fullstack engineer, you took ownership to streamline the experience and reduce human dependency in the provisioning flow.

**Action:**
You architected and built an **Internal Developer Portal (IDP)** using React and Golang, integrating Temporal workflows and AWS to orchestrate Linux server requests at scale. It aggregated real-time server metrics, automated provisioning, and gave engineers a self-service dashboard.

**Result:**

* Reduced request resolution time from hours to minutes
* Improved observability and reduced human error
* Empowered 10+ engineers to manage infra requests independently
* Became a model reused by other teams inside the org

🎯 **Demonstrates:** 10x thinking, scalability, enabling others to move faster.

### 💡 Case Study 2: **Custom Code Generator CLI for UI Automation**

## ✅ What You Did Well

| Area                     | Comments                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ **Real customer pain** | You clearly explained the growing complexity due to expanding data tables                        |
| ✅ **Scalable thinking**  | You identified the long-term bottleneck of manually building pages                               |
| ✅ **Ownership**          | You went beyond your task and built a CLI tool — this shows bias for action + long-term thinking |
| ✅ **Clear result**       | You quantified impact: 1 week → 30 mins turnaround per page                                      |

## 🛠 Suggestions to Improve for Interview

1. **Summarize up front**:

   * “We were scaling from 10 → 60+ datasets. Manually building UI pages didn’t scale. I built a codegen CLI to automate it.”
   * This hooks the interviewer early.

2. **Trim tech stack depth slightly unless asked**:

   * Keep `React + Next.js`, `Go microservices`, and `RDS` mentioned — but avoid deep internals unless it's a technical round.

3. **Emphasize enablement of others**:

   * Call out: “This tool was adopted by other teams. Even new devs with no context could now generate fully functional, styled, tested pages in minutes.”

4. **Result in bullet or sharp sentence**:

   * “This reduced UI delivery time from 1 week to under 30 minutes. Productivity improved 10x and unblocked future scale to 150+ datasets.”

## 🧠 Summary You Can Use in the Interview

> *“We were scaling from 10 to 60+ data pipelines, each needing a dashboard UI. Manually building these in React/Next.js took \~1 week per dataset. I foresaw this wouldn’t scale, so I built a CLI code generator that took schema + config and auto-generated full UI pages with test cases, hooks, and styling. This dropped build time to under 30 minutes. The tool enabled all teams to scale confidently as we grew to 100+ datasets. It was reused org-wide and dramatically boosted velocity.”*

When you're ready, say **“Next”** and I’ll ask a question for **Earn Trust**. You're doing great 🔥

## ✅ Earn Trust (2 Real Case Studies)

---

### 🤝 Case Study 1: **Pushing Back on Risky Client Request (Skuchain Project)**

**Situation:**
While building Skuchain (multi-tenant supply chain SaaS), a client requested custom logic requiring unsafe direct SQL access, risking tenancy isolation.

**Task:**
You had to ensure client satisfaction while protecting system design and data security.

**Action:**
You:

* Set up a stakeholder meeting with technical leads
* Clearly explained the risk of breaking tenant boundaries
* Proposed a safe alternative using scoped API wrappers and Dynamo query abstraction

**Result:**
Client agreed to the approach

* You delivered the feature **2 sprints earlier**
* System design stayed clean and extensible
* Team recognized you for upholding engineering standards without conflict

🎯 **Demonstrates:** Speaking up, earning credibility with both client and peers.

### 🤝 Case Study 2: **Refactoring Legacy Code to Onboard New Developers Faster**

**Situation:**
At your current Red Hat project, you inherited a legacy app built a decade ago with poor standards and documentation — while 3 new developers were scheduled to join.

**Task:**
You wanted to minimize onboarding friction and technical debt.

**Action:**
You:

* Introduced service-level documentation with code ownership
* Added ESLint, Prettier, and GitHub PR templates
* Set up pre-commit hooks and centralized logging with JSON + CloudWatch
* Created bootstrap templates for new modules

**Result:**

* New hires became productive in <1 week
* PR rejection rate dropped by 40%
* Team leads appreciated the systematic, scalable improvements

🎯 **Demonstrates:** Long-term thinking, accountability, and integrity.
