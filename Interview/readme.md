Great! Let's focus your prep for the phone screening round for the **Frontend AWS Developer Advocate** role. This round usually assesses:

1. **Technical Competency** (frontend tech + AWS)
2. **Communication Skills**
3. **Understanding of Developer Advocacy**
4. **Amazon Leadership Principles**

---

### 📌 Key Areas to Prepare

#### 1. **Frontend Technical Skills**

You should be comfortable discussing and explaining:

* **React / Next.js / TypeScript** (or Vue/Angular if applicable)
* Performance optimization techniques (lazy loading, SSR, hydration, etc.)
* Component design, state management (Redux, Context, Zustand, etc.)
* Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
* Testing (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress)
* CI/CD for frontend (especially using AWS tools like Amplify, CodePipeline)

Be ready to **explain architectural decisions**, tradeoffs, and how you ensure code quality in frontend apps.

#### 2. **AWS Knowledge**

Since this is AWS-focused, prepare to talk about:

* **Frontend hosting on AWS**: Amplify, CloudFront + S3, API Gateway + Lambda, Cognito
* Integrating with backend services (API Gateway, AppSync, DynamoDB, etc.)
* IAM basics — how you secure access from frontend
* Monitoring and observability (CloudWatch, Amplify Console)
* How you might migrate a React/Vue app to AWS infrastructure

Prepare **examples or mini use-cases** that demonstrate your practical experience with AWS in frontend apps.

#### 3. **Developer Advocacy**

They’ll expect you to show understanding of:

* **Who a developer advocate serves** (community, product, internal teams)
* How you create impactful **technical content** (blog posts, videos, talks, samples)
* Engaging with community (GitHub, StackOverflow, X/Twitter, Discord, conferences)
* Metrics for advocacy (adoption, views, contributions, feedback)

You’ll likely be asked:

> “How would you explain AWS Amplify or Serverless to a developer new to AWS?”

Prepare a **simple, clear explanation** like you're talking to a mid-level engineer or at a meet-up.

#### 4. **Leadership Principles (LPs)**

Expect behavioral questions grounded in Amazon's LPs. Key ones for this role:

* **Customer Obsession** – how have you helped devs?
* **Earn Trust** – handling feedback, collaboration
* **Dive Deep** – debugging a frontend issue or AWS service integration
* **Bias for Action** – launching a new dev tool/blog/docs
* **Learn and Be Curious** – learning new AWS services or frontend frameworks quickly

Use the **STAR method** to structure your responses:
**Situation → Task → Action → Result**

### 🧠 Sample Questions to Practice

#### 📌 Technical

* How do you optimize a React app for performance?
* Explain how you’d deploy a React + Node.js app using AWS services.
* What are the tradeoffs between using Amplify vs. manually using S3 + CloudFront + Cognito?

#### 📌 Advocacy

* Tell us about a piece of content you created that had an impact.
* How do you stay connected to the developer community?
* Describe a time you had to advocate for a developer need internally.

#### 📌 Behavioral (LPs)

* Tell me about a time you disagreed with a team decision.
* Give an example of how you handled a failed launch or content misfire.
* How do you prioritize between writing code, content, and engaging with community?

### ✅ What to Do Before the Interview

* **Review JD again carefully**: Understand what problems this team is solving and how you’d help.
* **Prepare 2–3 STAR stories**: Real examples from work that map to LPs and technical wins.
* **Review AWS Amplify, AppSync, CloudFront, and Cognito**: These are common for frontend roles.
* **Skim recent AWS frontend blog posts**: [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/)
* **Be ready to ask good questions**: e.g., "What does success look like in the first 6 months?" or "How does this role influence AWS product direction?"
